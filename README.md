# Intermediate Git

Plans and slides for a short course in intermediate Git consisting of
four one-hour class meetings. The intended audience is science
students who have begun to use Git via quickstart-style tutorials but
who find Git frustrating due to a lack of understanding of its
fundamental ideas. Thus, it emphasizes Git's intended usage patterns
and concepts such as the staging area and branching model.
